# minikube-test

## Install

### Install Minikube

First, minikube had to be installed, below are the few steps required on a MAC desktop.

```
% brew install minikube

% minikube kubectl -- get po -A
```

If you have to install minikube for linux or windows, check the following link and select your correct OS to get the instructions:

(Minikube - Get Started)[https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/]

### Install HyperKit

Then, the driver for minikube had to be installed.

I decide to use docker, but getting some issues when tried to connect to nginx below the error:

    `❗  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.`

Here a link with the error, and some folks there recommended to use HyperKit: 

[https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/9016]

Then I move to install HyperKit, [here the documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/hyperkit/) 

HyperKit is only for MAC, if you are using linux or Windows, check the options in the link below:

(Minikube - Drivers)[https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/]

You can choose any driver from the list, and see the option to install it and use it in minikube.


### Start minikube using HyperKit driver

After the HyperKit install I started the minikube using that driver, previously deleted the previous minikube using docker.

```
% minikube start driver=hyperkit

😄  minikube v1.25.2 on Darwin 12.3.1

🔑  The 'hyperkit' driver requires elevated permissions. The following commands will be executed:

```

> Note: if you are using a different driver you have to replace hyperkit for your preferred driver.

## Create the NGINX deployment

### Create

I used the below commmand to deploy nginx:

```
% kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:latest --port=80

pod/nginx created
```

Then, I exposed the port to connect from the localhost to test the nginx server:

```
% kubectl expose pod nginx  --type=NodePort

3service/nginx exposed
```

Lastly I get the url for connection, this step was the one failing when using docker driver:

```
% minikube service nginx --url

http://192.168.64.2:30239
```

## Get logs (`get-kubelogs.py`)

The script basically get the logs for any pod in kubernetes, it presents a menu with all the pods available not only for the namespace `default`, then select the pod and show the logs for that particular pod. Logs are shown like the `less` tool in linux, keys can be used to scroll the log text.

### Requirements

It was used a virtual environment with Python 3.8.8, and the required libraries are:
- console-menu
- rich
- kubernetes

Nevertheless, I listed the `requirements.txt` with all the libraries installed as depenncies, just for checking related libraries.

### Future features related to "show logs"

- Improves the menu
- Configure colors in logs to easily get information
- Configure regex to found errors and inform in the menu directly
- Filter pods with the most relevant
